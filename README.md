a. What is an issue?
When you encounter a bug, compatibility, configuration, environment or scripting error.

b. What is a pull request?
A process to provide proposed changes to the git repository.

c. How do I open up a pull request?
Go to relevant forked repositary on GitHub, click on pull requests on top horizontal row options and then click on the green button titled "New Pull Request"

1 - Within Github repository of interest, click settings in the top horizontal row options
2 - In the left hand column under access, click collaborators
3 - Then click the green "add people" button in the "manage access" section

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) and GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. Another difference is that git is installed locally on PCs, while Hithub is an online service built to run Git on the cloud.

f. What does git diff do?
Helps you see, compare, and understand changes in your project. It can show current changes in working copy, past changes in commits and also compare branches.

g. What is the main branch?
This is the branch that Github displays when anyone visits a repository. Also known as the default branch, it is also the initial branch that Git check out locally when someone clones the repository. It tends to be the latest stable version of the project.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?

No - this is not best practice. It is better to create feature branches that can be reviewed and changed in advance of integrating into the main branch. Integration can be completed through pull requests and/or merge requests.
